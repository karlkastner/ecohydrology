	% note 1 : F in Dodorico 20007 models the death by fire as a Poisson
	% process with rate l = l0 + b*V, i.e. on average occurs a fire
	% event in a particular grid cell every l time steps,
	% here, a continuous approach is chosen,
	% where at every time step vegetation proportional to 1/l dies off 
	%	  note that one of the stable states is larger zmax,
	%	  which should be interpreted as a retardation value rather than maximum
	% note 2 : dodorico 2007 does not mention a time or space step,
	%          though his choice of exponential and poisson distribution
	%	   seem to imply a time step of 1, and a space step of 1
	%          however,  system is numerically unstable for the parameters
	%	   proposed by DOrico:
	%	   dt_max <= dx^2/(4*e) = 1^2/(4*0.3) = 0.83
	% note 3: with the poisson distribution, several events can occur in the same time step,
	%	  as the pdf of the poissin distribution larger 0 at the origin
	%	  dodorico does not specify how this is treated

	% note that dodorico substracts f (inverse definition of sign)
	l = obj.p.l0 + obj.p.b.*z;
	%l = obj.p.l0.*exp(obj.p.b.*z);
