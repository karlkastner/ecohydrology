% note :
% a) without diffusion and constant coefficients, the value at each point converges to either value
%        of the two homogeneous stable states
% b) which state is chosen, is decided by the initial value, separated by the pole
%	hs1 ... pole  ... hs2
% c) with constant initial value, patterns can only form when the pole spatially varies
%    the poles are only influenced by l0 and b
% d) with diffusion, dx -> 0 and sd/dx const (gaussian error propagation)
%    the stationary points move towards the pole, until the distribution
%    of point values becomes uniform, i.e. there is no more pattern (bimodal distribution)
% -> since discretizing is equal to low-pass filtering, patterns only form when
%    the randomly varied parameter or ic is low-pass filtered
% e) dodorico 2006 and 2007 have different definitions of f
